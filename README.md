# Overview
If you are a frequent user of Spotify, you surely know about the "Discover Weekly" playlist that Spotify updates
each and every week with music recommendations that are tailored to your listening habits. Sadly, the playlist of 
one week is most likely very different from the playlist of another week. 

This Python script solves the problem of missing out on your favorite new song by saving each week's playlist
as another playlist of yours, labeled with the date, so that you never miss out on your next new favorite song.
